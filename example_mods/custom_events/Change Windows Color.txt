NOTICE: DOES NOT WORK

Only works on stages "salonroof" and soon "hotelroof".
Haven't tested "philly" yet but I doubt it works there.
Value 1 = Color to change to (example: FF0000 for red,
00FF00 for green, 0000FF for blue, FFFFFF for white,
000000 for black.). 0 = random default color.
Default colors: FF5050, FF9010, FFF080, 20FF20,
2023FF, FF80FF
